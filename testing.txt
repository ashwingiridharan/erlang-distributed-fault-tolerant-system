tf1.cfg
==============
1. Handle duplicate request for transfer (retransmit same reply)
2. Handle InsufficientFunds for transfer (create account if new, update history at all servers,
send reply from tail)

tf2.cfg
==============
1. Successful transfer in absence of failures, with both banks receiving pseudo-random
deposits and withdrawals from other clients while transfer is in progress.

tf3.cfg
==============
1. Successful transfer when head of bank2 fails immediately after receiving the transfer
request. to complete the transfer, a bank1 server needs to re-send the transfer request
to the new head of bank2

tf4.cfg
==============
1. Successful transfer when the bank1 server s1 that sends the transfer request to head of
bank2 fails immediately after sending it, and head of bank2 fails immediately after
receiving it. to complete the transfer, another bank1 server s1' needs to re-send the
transfer request to the new head of bank2. (in the suggested design for the transfer
operation, s1 is the original tail of bank1, and s1' is the predecessor of s1.)
